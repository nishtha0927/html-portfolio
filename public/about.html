<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Nishtha Sharma and currently I am pursuing Btech from Vellore institute of technology in the field of computer science. I have done my schooling from Dayawati Modi Academy, Meerut branch.
  So far, I have worked as an AEH intern at Accenture where I got the chance to work on various services in the Azure cloud platform such as ADX, ADF, external tables, pipelines etc.
  Apart from the internship I have developed some personal and team projects also.
  The first one is The Detection of breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms. It was a team project where my role was that of a data analyst.
  The second project is my individual project which is the Instagram design UI. In this project I have tried to optimize the design and make it more user friendly so that the users can easily read the chats, watch reels etc. 
  And the third project is bangalore house price detection 
  These projects are developed using the waterfall method.
